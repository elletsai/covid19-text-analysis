Thirty-seven states have closed public schools in light of the outbreak.\\n\"As I attempt to home school my kids (alone) with a new baby who screams if she isn\\'t held, I am worried about the health of my spouse and my family,\" she said.\\nPatzer also expressed frustration with people who have chosen not to practice \"social distancing,\" a recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined as \"remaining out of places where people meet or gather\" and \"avoiding local public transportation\" --  even if one does not have any symptoms of the virus -- as a way to slow the spread of the disease. The Trump administration also unveiled new guidelines on Monday advising people to avoid gathering in groups of more than 10, going to bars, restaurants and food courts, and non-essential traveling to staunch the spread of the pandemic.\\n\"It is difficult to see pictures of all the people at bars and restaurants, socializing, making play dates, and ignoring social distancing recommendations when I know my husband and many other health care workers are risking their lives to treat more sick patients,\" Patzer said.\\nShe urged people to take the outbreak seriously and to \"please thank a health care worker for what they are doing and sacrificing.\"\\nCNN\\'s Devan Cole contributed to this report.'"

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday he will announce new restrictions on gatherings to halt the spread of the new coronavirus in the coming days. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms. For some it can cause more severe illness. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)\\n      The shows affected by the Broadway shutdown included such big hits as \"Hamilton\" and \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\"Next week’s historic St. Patrick’s Day parade down Fifth Avenue, an event that attracts two million people each year, was also a casualty of the coronavirus.At the same time, restaurants and bars were noticeably emptier.

How am I going to survive this?”The closures, cancelations and\\xa0changes come\\xa0as officials seek\\xa0to contain the virus and mitigate the spread.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in New York City stayed at 95 as of Friday morning, officials said.The total number of coronavirus cases in New York State was 328, second-most in the country behind Washington state which had 457 cases.\\n      The Minskoff Theatre is shuttered Thursday, March 12, 2020, in New York, near Times Square after Broadway theaters closed following New York Gov.

We need folks to show up at work. We need our public servants to be where we need them to be to take care of folks -- hospitals, schools, first responders.”De Blasio said he didn\\'t want to close public schools because of their\\xa0importance to the communities they serve.An exception was New Dorp High School on Staten Island, which was ordered closed Friday after a student tested positive for the corona virus, according to the Staten Island Advance.The total number of people with the virus\\xa0in New York City wasn\\'t known due to the relative scarcity of tests.But\\xa0for some, the danger is all too real.\\n      A pedestrian passes an entrance to the Barclays Center in the Brooklyn borough of New York on Thursday, March 12, 2020, after the NCAA\\'s Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament was announced cancelled due to concerns over the COVID-19 coronavirus.
